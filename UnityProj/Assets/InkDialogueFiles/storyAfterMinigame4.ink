- [EON] Well done mortal. I haven't had a break like this in 13792 years. I am truly in your debt.
    * [Now will you release the souls of my people?]
- [EON] I can grant you and your people passage back to the overworld, but I must get back to work, and thus it is your responsibility to collect their souls from the depths.
    * [Where are they?]
- [EON] I will transport you to the chamber where they are held. You must collect their souls without interfering with any of my minions. For they will see you as a threat, and I cannot garantuee their cooperation.
    * [I understand]
- [EON] Farewell, friend.
    * Start
